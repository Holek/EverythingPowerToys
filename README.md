# Everything for PowerToys Run
---
This repo is to be used as a submodule for [PowerToys repo](https://github.com/lin-ycv/PowerToys/tree/Everything), this will not compile when used standalone, as it's missing references from PowerToys.

The release is the compiled result of this repo, extract the downloaded folder to `C:\Program Files\PowerToys\modules\launcher\Plugins`

[Everything](https://www.voidtools.com/downloads/) has to be downloaded seperately, and be running in order for this pluging to work.<br>
**\*This does not work with the lite version of Everything, it does not support IPC**<br>
*if you are on 1.5 alpha, you need to [Disable 1.5a Instance](http://www.voidtools.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=12&t=9799#instance)*
